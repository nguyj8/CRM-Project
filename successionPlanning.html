    <h1>Succession Planning</h1>
    <h3 class="description">
        Have you planned for the time when you're gone? Who will receive your assets? Who will assume control of your business? Who will bear the burden of your unpaid expenses? 
        Without a written plan, you will leave much of the decision-making up to the state and your already grieving family.
