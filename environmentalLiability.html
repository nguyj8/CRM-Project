    <h1>Environmental Liability</h1>
    <h3 class="description">
        What types of liquids do you store in your facilities? What about in your vehicles? Your business would be 
        responsible for cleaning up a spill or leak from an accident, job site, or larger claim as well as covering 
        any physical damage or bodily injury losses.

        Environmental Liability protection, also known as pollution insurance, is available to help protect your 
        business in the event of a pollution-related incident.
