    <h1>Commercial Umbrella</h1>
    <h3 class="description">
        In our increasingly litigious society, multimillion-dollar settlements are not uncommon. Add legal fees 
        and the expense is staggering. An unexpected catastrophe could result in a large judgment against your 
        company. Without adequate protection, your company's assets (or even your personal assets) could be placed 
        in financial jeopardy.

        If you get in an accident and only damage your vehicle, you are probably covered. If you get in an accident 
        and damage five vehicles and injure three drivers, how much do you think the claim will cost? What about a 
        serious slip and fall incident at your business? Jury verdicts keep rising and rising.
